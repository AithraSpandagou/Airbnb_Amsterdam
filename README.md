# Airbnb Amsterdam
 
[Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/index.html) is an independent open-source data tool developed by community activist Murray Cox who aims to shed light on how Airbnb is being used and affecting neighborhoods in large cities. The tool provides a visual overview of the amount. availability, and spread of rooms across a city, an approximation of the number of bookings and occupancy rate, and the number of listings per host. 

For example, [here](http://insideairbnb.com/amsterdam/) is the dashboard for the city of Amsterdam which shows us that 79% of the 19,619 listings are entire homes of which about a quarter is available all year round. Moreover, the animation below illustrates how the number of listings have been growing rapidly throughout the years:
